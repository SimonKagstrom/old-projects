CONV2REX
--------
conv2rex converts images to REX 6000 bitmaps (to include in
c-files), REX binary files and icon (resurce files). White in
the image is assumed to be clear areas, black filled. The images
can have any pixeldepth and be of any format supported by 
SDL_Image.

Usage:
conv2rex [options] infile outfile

Options are:
-h                This text
-c                Create C-source (default) file
-i                Create icon (resource) file
-b                Create binary file
-s                Create stripped binary file (no width/height. Used
                  for the icons etc)
-u                Use uint8_t instead of char (only if not binary file)
-n NAME           Specify the name of the bitmap (normally p_image)
