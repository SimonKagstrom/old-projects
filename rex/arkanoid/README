Arkanoid
--------
This is a Arkanoid game for the REX 6000. It is also playable on UNIX
systems with libsdl (see www.libsdl.org), although the SDL port is
mostly for testing.

The aim of the game is to keep the ball within the playfield and
remove all blocks ;-).

Although this isn't cardware, I like the cardware concept. Therefore,

Controls
--------
The controls are pretty simple: The up/left-key moves the paddle to
the left, the down/right-key moves the paddle to the right and the
enter-key shoots the ball away if it is held.

You can also move the paddle with the stylus. If you point to the left
of the paddle, the paddle will move left. Obviously, pointing to the
right of the paddle will move it to the right. You can also shoot the
ball away by pointing on the upper half of the screen.

You can select which level to start at by editing the second number in
the arkanoid Memo. Note that the first level is 0, so to play the
second level, you replace this with 1. Don't add anything else (like
extra spaces etc) to this file.


Installing
----------
The REX executable should come with the source (arkanoid.rex), but if
you want to change it in some way, a recompile is necessary.

UNIX:
 run make or make arkanoid.bin. The first option builds the SDL
 executable as well. GNU Make is required.

Other systems:
 run  zcc +rex -O2 -vn -create-app -D_NOFLOAT_ -DTARGET_REX -o arkanoid.bin arkanoid.c draw.c sysdeps/rex_sysdeps.c
 to build the REX exectuable. The SDL executable can probably also be
 compiled, but I'm not familiar with how it's done.

When you have the REX executable, copy that to your REX with REXTools
or something like that. You should also copy the Zarkanoid.txt file to
your rex (also with REXTools), which will add the levels as a memo
with the name arkanoid.


Adding levels
-------------
The levels are found in the Zarkanoid.txt file, and have a simple but
strict format. An example will help the explaining:

--File begins--
02
00
0000000000
0151551110
0515115510
0111111110
0151511510
0111115110
0515151510
0111551110
0000000000

0000000000
6226222622
1111115111
1151111111
5111551151
1111001111
1150000111
1100000051
1000000005
--File ends--

This is how the first two levels look, more levels would just follow
this pattern.

Now. Each line above ends with \n and NOTHING more. That is, you
should take care to not have any trailing spaces or CR/LF's like some
systems like to add. After each level, an additional \n is added.

The first number in the file states the number of levels. The second
number states what level to start at, and note that the first level is
level 0. The two numbers both contains exactly two digits (maximum
99).

After the two initial numbers, each level consists of 10*9 numbers,
with every number denoting the type for the corresponding block.

The type should be set to the number of hits added with *if* its a
special or not (TYPE_SPECIAL == 4, see arkanoid.h). I.e:

0 hits (empty block):       0
1 hit, no special:          1
1 hit, special:             1 + 4 = 5
2 hits, no special:         2
2 hits, special:            2 + 4 = 6
infinite hits, no special:  3
infinite hits, special:     3 + 4 = 7

Infinite hits really means 255 hits, and you really shouldn't place
specials at such places :-)
