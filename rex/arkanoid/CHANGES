0.9 -> 0.9.1
* Changed the name of the level-file to Zarkanoid.txt instead.
* Maximum number of lives is now 5 (and default is 4)
* Runs in the emulator at least :-), applied some nasty tricks to have
  it compile correctly with zcc

0.4 -> 0.9
* Ported arkanoid to the new libfe REX abstraction layer. Should be
  easier to extend now.
* More "realistic" ball bouncing
* New graphics (not sure if it's actually better now, but...)
* Misc. code cleanup
* Makefile is now a bit more intelligent, but also more UNIX
  specific
* Removed cvs logs
* Redraw the number of lives when the player takes an extra-life
  special
* Fixed the README


0.3 -> 0.4
* Added 6 levels (now 20 levels total).
* Level skipping is done 5 levels at a time.

0.2 -> 0.3

* Added floor-special. A floor protects the ball from falling
  out of the field for three times.
* Simplified the SDL-frontend.
* Added touch screen support for the REX frontend.
* Removed a graphical glitch when the ball exits the screen.
* Added comments on a few places in the code in order to make it
  more readable.
* Reorganized some code in order to save some bytes of code. There
  is now about 15 bytes of code left to implement stuff in :-)


0.1 -> 0.2

* Now loads levels from a file. Allows for up to 99 levels.
* Better distribution of specials.
* Sticky and destroyer specials now disappears after a while.
* The game does not slow down as much when several things are
  moving as it used to.
* Faster gameplay
* The playing field has grown by one block horizontally.
* Added "impossible" blocks (demands 255 hits to be destroyed)
  This is buggy.
* Lots of code rework.


0.1

* Initial release
