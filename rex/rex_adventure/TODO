rex_sysdeps.c:
  * Reimplement fe_draw_bitmap() in assembly
    - Current solution is slow.
    - Also fix drawing of width == 32

advgame.c:
  * When on an event point, the current action is executed before the player stops.
  *Drop object is not possible when on an event-point.
    - Remove drop?

library issues:
  * The library cannot call functions within itself (offset problems)
    - Can this be solved by only changing the offset of the wrapper functions?
    - Solved



Sometime:
  * Move sysdeps.h to sysdeps/include/sysdeps/ or felib/include/felib/ or
    something.
