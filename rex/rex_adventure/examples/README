Here are some examples of the libraries found here.

sysdeps_test/  A test of the system-dependencies. Will draw some
               things on the screen and read from a memo.
advlib_test/   A test program for advlib. Will load a map and display that
               on the screen (together with a player sprite blitted on the map).
null_game/     An empty game. You can walk around the world but cannot do anything
               other than exiting.
example_game/  An example game. Very, very small. You can look at stuff and do
               things with one of the trees.
