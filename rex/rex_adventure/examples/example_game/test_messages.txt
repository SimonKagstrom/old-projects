The rope looks strong.                          
The fruit is bright red and looks juicy.        
The coins are very dirty.                       
The bottle has a "MrProper" label on it.        
The coins shine brightly in the sun.            
....                                            
..                                              
....

....

You are dead. Better luck next time!            
Why would you want to do that?                  
You pick up the item.                           
You drop the item.                              
You cannot take that.                           
That is not the way to use the item.            
I see nothing special about that.               
The road ends at a mountain range. A troll is   
guarding something on a rock. It looks fierce.  
The road ends in a rubble of rocks. There are   
a few trees here.                               
Mountains blocks the passage to the east. The   
ground is barren here.                          
A road continues north. There are trees here,   
one of them has many red fruits.                
The road bends to the south. There are rocks and
trees here, but all look uninteresting.         
A mountain range blocks the passage to the east 
and south. There are no trees here.             
A few rocks and trees can be seen here.         
Mountains block the path to the east.           
The road ends at a small cabin. The cabin has a 
garden facing north and a door facing south.    
You stand in a room. There are three tables     
here. The exit is to the south.                 
Red fruits can be seen high in the tree.        
You throw the rope around a branch high up in   
the tree, climb up and take one of the fruits.  
The troll looks greedy.                         
The troll eats the fruit. Me wants gold! it     
shouts. The troll seems to want gold.           
The troll is too heavy to carry.                
You give the coins to the troll. The troll      
grunts happily and disappears from its rock.    
You look through the garden. Under some bushes  
you find a bunch of golden coins.               
The door is locked.                             
A bottle is on the table.                       
You take the bottle.                            
You apply MrProper to the coins. They coins are 
now shining brightly.
