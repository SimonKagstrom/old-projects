The rope looks strong.                  
The fruit is red and looks juicy.       
The potion has a strange red shimmer.

You are dead. Better luck next time!    
Why would you want to do that?          
You pick up the item.                   
You drop the item.                      
You cannot take that.                   
That is not the way to use the item.    
I see nothing special about that.

A road continues north. There are trees 
here, one of them seems to have fruits. 
A desert continues to the east, north   
and south.                              
Red fruits can be seen high in the tree.
You throw the rope around a branch high 
in the tree, climb up and take a fruit.
