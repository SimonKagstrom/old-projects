Installation instructions for REX adventure
-------------------------------------------
If this is a binary release, you should upload the library to your REX
with RexTools just as with any other addin.

  advglib.rex

For games that use the library, like example_game.rex, you need to
upload both the .rex executable, a messages memo and a scene memo,
i.e. (for example_game):

  example_game.rex
  test_messages.txt
  test_scene.txt



Run in the emulator
-------------------

To run in the emulator, you first need to install the library in the
emulator. For example:

  $ mkemu advglib.b2 PATH_TO_EMULATOR 4

Then you need to create the memos needed for the game. You do this by
running

  wr_test_messages.rex
  wr_test_scene.rex

After this (reset the emulator, but don't restart it between rounds),
you can load the game into the emulator (example_game.rex).



Compile from source
-------------------
Compiling REX adventure from source might be a bit more work. REX
adventure currently only works with rexdk/z88dk (RxSDK/sdcc needs
library-support and memo-reading to work). To compile, a few things
are needed (for z88dk, I'm not sure which of these applies to rexdk):

 - You need to increase the maximum number of include-directories for
   the preprocessor, change
    #define        NINCLUDE                  7
   to
    #define        NINCLUDE                  14
   in z88dk/src/cpp/cppdef.h and recompile z88dk.

 - You need a DsClearPixel(). This is just a hacked version of Waleeds
   DsSetPixel(), and with some luck Daniel have included it in
   rexdk. Otherwise, I can send it to you.

 - For UNIX-systems, you need GNU Make to compile the sources. Perhaps
   someone can contribute a make.bat file for windows systems?

 - You need mklib found in rexdk to create the library. mkemu can also
   be useful, although strictly not needed.

 - (Not needed, but convenient): conv2rex and writememo.

I'll try to make the thing more easily installed in the future.
