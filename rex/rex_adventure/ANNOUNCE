Hello!

I'd like to announce the inital release of the "REX Adventure"
adventure game library. REX Adventure is a REX library for writing
Zelda/Monkey Island-style games (a mixture of both kinds), for running
on the REX or on a host machine with libSDL. REX Adventure is actually
two libraries:

advlib/ - A graphics support library for REX Adventure. Draws maps and
          blits sprites.
advglib/ - (Notice the 'g' :-)) The actual adventure game library.

advglib depends on advlib, but advlib can be used without advglib. A
"development environment" is also provided, that implements an
abstraction layer between the REX-specific functions and the platform
independent code. The library therefore is also available for libSDL
on UNIX (possibly windows) systems.

An example game is also provided. Screenshots from that can be seen on
my homepage.

The library is released under the GNU GPL, and can be downloaded from
my homepage:

--------
Now for some things to watch out when you try it:

* The game is a bit slow still, but I hope to be able to speed it up
  sometime.
* See the INSTALL document before testing the game - you need to
  download two memos to the REX as well.
* I have only tried the library/game in the emulator (no access to
  my docking station right now). It works in the emulator, but if it
  does not work on the real thing, I suspect memo-reading...
* If someone would like to try to program for it, I'd be happy to
  help. Note that to compile the library, you might need to recompile
  z88dk/rexdk.

Have fun!
