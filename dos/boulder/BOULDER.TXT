1. Game
-------
Use arrows for basic movement, left shift to push objects away from you.
Escape to suicide. Walls cannot be passed, though weak walls (darker)
can be blown away. Teleporters move you to another teleporter (randomly.)
Pull levers to set off bombs or falling stones, beware of traps!

boulder.exe - normal game (standard keyboard handler)
b_altkey.exe - own keyboard handler (works, but can hang the system)
b_txt.exe - the first version of this game, textbased!

... Have fun!

2. Editing Maps
---------------
Maps are created in an Ansi-Editor, but please consider the following
rules:

* You must put a border of walls (±) around the playfield.
* The field must not be greater than 48 rows.
* At the end of the file, at the three last positions, enter the number of
  diamonds required to finish the level. It should look something like
  this:
±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±± [..] (the bottom wall)
  8                       [..] (diamonds needed)
  In this case, 8 diamonds are needed. Remeber to pad with spaces if the
  number if lower than 100, i.e do NOT enter 008.
* The player starts at (ù ASCII 249)...
* ... and exits the level at (Û)
* Letters 'a' and 'A' represents a lever, and a boulder-creating wall.
  You may only enter one 'a' and one 'A'.
* 'b' triggers a bomb at 'B'.
* 'c' is a hidden lever that sends a wall downwards at 'C'.
* '*' is a moveable block.

Other rules:
999 maps are allowed, ordered by file-extention. (boulder.xxx, i.e
boulder.1 [..] boulder.999).
500 boulders, diamonds, enemies, moveable blocks and teleporters can be
applied to every level.
